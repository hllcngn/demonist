# demonist (WIP title)
A WIP 2D simulation game prototype

### usage
`make hello` to test if SDL2 is working properly on your computer\
`make` to build the game\
NB: If it doesn't work yet, a rule will be added to build for Linux.\
[Cygwin users] /!\ If you use Cygwin to build the game, and want to launch it from outside of Cygwin, copy the cygwin1.dll from the lib folder into the folder of the executable. Be aware that this will prevent building the game again to work, you will need to put the dll back into another folder (eg the lib folder) in order to build again, then re-paste the dll in the executable's folder again to run it again after having rebuilt it.

### config
You can edit the controls and other settings in config.h before compiling the game.

### testing the game
If you are willing to try out the game and give feedback, thanks, much appreciated.
No matter what stage it's at, you'll get it for free when (if) it is released.
